# 🚲 **SpinLock – Intelligent Bike Parking & Anti-Theft System**

## 📜 **About the Project**

**SpinLock** is an IoT-driven Intelligent Bike Parking & Anti-Theft System designed to enhance bike security and solve the problem of secure parking availability in urban areas. The system integrates hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure to provide a comprehensive solution for urban bike parking challenges.

### 🎯 **Key Components:**

* **Embedded IoT Device (ESP32-based)** with GPS tracking, motion detection, and dual connectivity (Wi-Fi + GSM fallback)
* **Mobile App (Flutter)** for bike owners and parking agents to track bikes, receive alerts, and manage parking
* **Admin Dashboard (ReactJS)** for system administrators to manage users, devices, and parking infrastructure
* **Microservices Backend** with event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka and MQTT for real-time IoT communication
* **Docker-Compose Orchestration** for easy deployment and infrastructure management
